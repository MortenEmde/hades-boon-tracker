# Hades Boon Tracker

With this project, I wanted to build a helping tool for the Roguelike PC game [Hades](https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades/)

During your gameplay, you get access to powers (boons) from the Greek gods.<br />
This tool is designed to give you an overview of the tech-tree for each god.<br />
(What boon do I need to pick to unlock the next?)

Having studied up on TypeScript and code structure I wanted to challenge myself by following a strict structure for to Client-side code.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Server

In the Server directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the server on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).<br />
The page will reload if you make edits.

## Client

In the Client directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the application on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).<br />
The page will reload if you make edits.

### note:
It is required to have the server running to use the app as this serves the app with Boon data.
